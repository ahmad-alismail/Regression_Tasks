This project teaches linear regression fundamentals through hands-on implementation and interactive visualizations. You'll learn to predict sales based on TV advertising budget using three different methods:

1. **Analytical Solution** - Direct calculation using statistical formulas
2. **Matrix Form** - Linear algebra approach with normal equations
3. **Gradient Descent** - Iterative optimization algorithm

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



3. **Open the main tutorial notebook:**
   - Navigate to L1_Ãœbung.ipynb



## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The **Advertising dataset** contains 200 markets with:
- **TV**: TV advertising budget ($)
- **radio**: Radio advertising budget ($)
- **newspaper**: Newspaper advertising budget ($)
- **sales**: Product sales (thousands of units)

Focus: Predicting `sales` from `TV` budget using simple linear regression.
